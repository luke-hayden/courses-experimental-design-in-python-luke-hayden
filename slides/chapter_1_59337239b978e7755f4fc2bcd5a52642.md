## From observed pattern to reliable result

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "9622562193"
```

`@part1`
Where variation is present, we can see many different patterns in our data. 


Some of these are real, while others are just the results of chance. 


How can we work out whether a perceived difference is real?

## Null hypothesis vs alternative hypothesis

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "1adfecb6ee"
```

`@part1`
**Null hypothesis**

No difference between group A and group B. 
Both groups have the same mean population-level mean. 

_A = B_


`@part2`
**![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luke-hayden/courses-experimental-design-in-python-luke-hayden/master/unimod.png)**


`@part3`
**Alternative hypothesis**

This is the "more interesting" alternative: these two populations are meaningfully different. 

_A != B_

## Some statistical terms

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "17c0b4b679"
```

`@part1`
**p-value**

A p-value can quantify how likely it is that we would observe a particular pattern under the **null hypothesis.** A low p-value means that it's very unlikely that the observed pattern would have emerged under the null hypothesis. 

**alpha**

Alpha is the term used for the crucial threshold of p-value, below which we would reject the null hypothesis. Usually: 

_alpha < 0.05: reject null hypothesis_

## Student's t-test (two-sample)

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "ee2f383474"
```

`@part1`
**Background**

Invented by William Sealy Gosset, while working on methods to test beer quality. 

**Use**

Given two samples, tests whether the means of the populations from which these samples are drawn are equal.
