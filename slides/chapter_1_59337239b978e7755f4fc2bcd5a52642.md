Our first hypothesis test: Student's t-test

## Testing a hypothesis

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "9622562193"
```

`@part1`
Where variation is present, we can see many different patterns in our data. 

Some of these are real, while others are just the results of chance. 

How can we work out whether a perceived difference is real?
