Our first hypothesis test: Student's t-test

## From observed pattern to reliable result

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "9622562193"
```

`@part1`
Where variation is present, we can see many different patterns in our data. 

Some of these are real, while others are just the results of chance. 

How can we work out whether a perceived difference is real?

## Null hypothesis vs alternative hypothesis

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "1adfecb6ee"
```

`@part1`
**Null hypothesis**

This is our basic starting point: no difference between sample 1 and sample 2
